I created a website using flask and basic HTML that performs CRUD operations.

Follwing is the way to run the application:
-Install all the required libraries such as python, flask and sqlite.
-First of all, Run the table.py usinng the command python table.py that will create a required table in database.db
-Then run the main application app.py using python app.py that runs under the url: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

How to use the application:
To insert the data, fill the Scores list and press the button "Add Score"

To update or delete it, there will be the list of datas displayed in the website and there will also be buttos: "Update" and "Delete". You can type new data and press update to update the database, or delete the data from db using Delete button.
